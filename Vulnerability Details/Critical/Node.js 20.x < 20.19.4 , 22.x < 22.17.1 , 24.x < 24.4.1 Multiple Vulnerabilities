Node.js 20.x < 20.19.4 / 22.x < 22.17.1 / 24.x < 24.4.1 Multiple Vulnerabilities (Tuesday, July 15, 2025 Security Releases).
Description
The version of Node.js installed on the remote host is prior to 20.19.4, 22.17.1, 24.4.1. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the Tuesday, July 15, 2025 Security Releases advisory.

- The V8 release used in Node.js v24.0.0 has changed how string hashes are computed using rapidhash. This implementation re-introduces the HashDoS vulnerability as an attacker who can control the strings to be hashed can generate many hash collisions - an attacker can generate collisions even without knowing the hash-seed. While the V8 team does not classify this as a security vulnerability, the Node.js project considers it one due to its potential impact in real-world scenarios. Impact: Thank you, to sharp_edged for reporting this vulnerability and thank you targos for fixing it. (CVE-2025-27209)

- An incomplete fix has been identified for CVE-2025-23084 in Node.js, specifically affecting Windows device names like CON, PRN, and AUX. This vulnerability affects Windows users of path.join API. Impact: Thank you, to oblivionsage for reporting this vulnerability and thank you RafaelGSS for fixing it.
(CVE-2025-27210)

Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.
