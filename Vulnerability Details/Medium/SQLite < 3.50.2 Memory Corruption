SQLite < 3.50.2 Memory Corruption
Description
The version of SQLite installed on the remote host is prior to 3.50.2. It is, therefore, affected by a memory corruption issue. The vulnerability can occur where the number of aggregate terms could exceed the number of columns available, leading to memory corruption.

Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.
Solution
Upgrade to SQLite 3.50.2 or later.
