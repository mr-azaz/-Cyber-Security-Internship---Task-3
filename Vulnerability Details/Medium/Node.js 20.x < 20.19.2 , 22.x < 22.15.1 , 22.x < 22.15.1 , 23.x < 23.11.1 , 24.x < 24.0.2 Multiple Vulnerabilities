Node.js 20.x < 20.19.2 / 22.x < 22.15.1 / 22.x < 22.15.1 / 23.x < 23.11.1 / 24.x < 24.0.2 Multiple Vulnerabilities (Wednesday, May 14, 2025 Security Releases).
Description
The version of Node.js installed on the remote host is prior to 20.19.2, 22.15.1, 22.15.1, 23.11.1, 24.0.2. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the Wednesday, May 14, 2025 Security Releases advisory.

- In Node.js, the ReadFileUtf8 internal binding leaks memory due to a corrupted pointer in uv_fs_s.file: a UTF-16 path buffer is allocated but subsequently overwritten when the file descriptor is set. This results in an unrecoverable memory leak on every call. Repeated use can cause unbounded memory growth, leading to a denial of service. Impact: Thank you, to Justin Nietzel for reporting and fixing this vulnerability.
(CVE-2025-23165)

- The C++ method SignTraits::DeriveBits() may incorrectly call ThrowException() based on user-supplied inputs when executing in a background thread, crashing the Node.js process. Such cryptographic operations are commonly applied to untrusted inputs. Thus, this mechanism potentially allows an adversary to remotely crash a Node.js runtime. Impact: Thank you, @panva and @tniessen, for reporting and fixing this vulnerability. (CVE-2025-23166)

- A flaw in Node.js 20's HTTP parser allows improper termination of HTTP/1 headers using \r\n\rX instead of the required \r\n\r\n. This inconsistency enables request smuggling, allowing attackers to bypass proxy- based access controls and submit unauthorized requests. The issue was resolved by upgrading llhttp to version 9, which enforces correct header termination. Impact: Thank you, to kenballus for reporting this vulnerability and thank you RafaelGSS for fixing it. (CVE-2025-23167)

Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.
Solution
Upgrade to Node.js version 20.19.2 / 22.15.1 / 22.15.1 / 23.11.1 / 24.0.2 or later.
