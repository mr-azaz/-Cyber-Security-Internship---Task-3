SQLite 3.44.0 < 3.49.1 Multiple Vulnerabilities
Description
The version of SQLite installed on the remote host is 3.44.0 through 3.49.0 before 3.49.1. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities:

- In SQLite 3.44.0 through 3.49.0 before 3.49.1, the concat_ws() SQL function can cause memory to be written beyond the end of a malloc-allocated buffer. If the separator argument is attacker-controlled and has a large string (e.g., 2MB or more), an integer overflow occurs in calculating the size of the result buffer, and thus malloc may not allocate enough memory. (CVE-2025-29087)

- An integer overflow can be triggered in SQLite's `concat_ws()` function. The resulting, truncated integer is then used to allocate a buffer. When SQLite then writes the resulting string to the buffer, it uses the original, untruncated size and thus a wild Heap Buffer overflow of size ~4GB can be triggered. This can result in arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2025-3277)

Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.
Solution
Upgrade to SQLite 3.49.1 or later.
