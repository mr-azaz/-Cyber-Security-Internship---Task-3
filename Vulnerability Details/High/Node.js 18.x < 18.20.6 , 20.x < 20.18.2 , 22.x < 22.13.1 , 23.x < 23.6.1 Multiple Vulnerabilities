Node.js 18.x < 18.20.6 / 20.x < 20.18.2 / 22.x < 22.13.1 / 23.x < 23.6.1 Multiple Vulnerabilities (Tuesday, January 21, 2025 Security Releases).
Description
The version of Node.js installed on the remote host is prior to 18.20.6, 20.18.2, 22.13.1, 23.6.1. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the Tuesday, January 21, 2025 Security Releases advisory.

- A memory leak could occur when a remote peer abruptly closes the socket without sending a GOAWAY notification. Additionally, if an invalid header was detected by nghttp2, causing the connection to be terminated by the peer, the same leak was triggered. This flaw could lead to increased memory consumption and potential denial of service under certain conditions. This vulnerability affects HTTP/2 Server users on Node.js v18.x, v20.x, v22.x and v23.x. Impact: Thank you, to newtmitch for reporting this vulnerability and thank you RafaelGSS for fixing it. (CVE-2025-23085)

- With the aid of the diagnostics_channel utility, an event can be hooked into whenever a worker thread is created. This is not limited only to workers but also exposes internal workers, where an instance of them can be fetched, and its constructor can be grabbed and reinstated for malicious usage. This vulnerability affects Permission Model users (--permission) on Node.js v20, v22, and v23. Impact: Thank you, to leodog896 for reporting this vulnerability and thank you RafaelGSS for fixing it. (CVE-2025-23083)

Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.
